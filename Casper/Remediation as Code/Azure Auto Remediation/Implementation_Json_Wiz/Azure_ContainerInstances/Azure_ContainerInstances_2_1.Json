    "description": "Container images consist of multiple software layers, and each software layer might have vulnerabilities. A private registry like Azure Container Registry or Docker Trusted Registry must be used to store and retrieve images to help reduce the threat of attacks. Managed private registry supported by service principal-based authentication and role-based access for read-only (pull), write (push) can be used to secure the container images. Please refer ACR runbook for more details on private container Registry.",
