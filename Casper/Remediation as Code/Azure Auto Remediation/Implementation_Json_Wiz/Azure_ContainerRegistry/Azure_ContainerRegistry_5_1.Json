    "label": "Ensure Azure container Registry access is granted only using Managed Identities",
    "description": "Managed identity enables Azure resources to authenticate to cloud services (e.g. Azure Key Vault) without storing credentials in code. Once enabled, all necessary permissions can be granted via Azure role-based-access-control. In system assigned managed identity, the lifecycle of this type of managed identity is tied to the lifecycle of this resource. Additionally, each resource (e.g. Virtual Machine) can only have one system assigned managed identity. In User assigned managed identity, managed identities are created as standalone Azure resources, and have their own lifecycle. A single resource (e.g. Virtual Machine) can utilize multiple user assigned managed identities. A single user assigned managed identity can be shared across multiple resources. To access the container images from the container registry, An user-assigned or system-assigned managed identity must be setup on a Linux VM. Similarly an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster must be setup to use the managed identity to pull container images from Azure Container Registry for pod deployments.",
