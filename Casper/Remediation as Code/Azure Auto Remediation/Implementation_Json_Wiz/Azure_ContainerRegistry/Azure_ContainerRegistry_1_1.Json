    "description": "Access to azure container registry must be limited by assigning virtual network private IP addresses to the registry endpoints using Azure Private Link. Private endpoint will provide a endpoint with Private IP which can be associated with VNet with in tenant, other tenant or from On premise, eliminating exposure from the public internet. To connect to the Azure service over private endpoint, DNS settings must be configured via private DNS zones. Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the connection must be mentioned in the DNS settings which resolves to the private IP address of the private endpoint.Security can be enhanced by migrating from public endpoint to private endpoint which must be resolved using Private DNS.",
