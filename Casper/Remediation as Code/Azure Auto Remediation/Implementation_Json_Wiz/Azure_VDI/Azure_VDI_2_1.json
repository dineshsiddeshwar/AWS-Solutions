  "description": "The public IP address network service can be used to connect the virtual desktops in the virtual network with the internet. The public IP in virtual Machines are getting exposed and making the devices more vulnerable to security attacks. Since Organization uses on-prem data center to route all the network traffic to azure resource using Spoke-hub network model, NATing will be done at the data center and private IP of the VM are used to route the appropriate network traffic, hence no public IP is required.",
