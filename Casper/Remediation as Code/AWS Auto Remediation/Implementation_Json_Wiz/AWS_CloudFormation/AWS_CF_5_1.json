    "description": "Ensure all CloudFormation stacks are using Simple Notification Service (AWS SNS) in order to receive notifications when an event occurs. Monitoring stack events such as create - which triggers the provisioning process based on a defined CloudFormation template, update – which updates the stack configuration or delete – which terminates the stack by removing its collection of AWS resources, will enable to respond fast to any unauthorized action that could alter AWS environment. SNS integration can increase the visibility of AWS CloudFormation stack activity, beneficial for security and management purposes.",
