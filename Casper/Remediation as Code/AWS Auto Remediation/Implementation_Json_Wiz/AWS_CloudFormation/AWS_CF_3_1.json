    "description": "Ensure AWS CloudFormation stacks are using policies as a fail-safe mechanism in order to prevent accidental updates to stack resources. A CloudFormation stack policy is a JSON-based document that defines which actions can be performed on specified resources. The safety feature can be enabled when the CloudFormation stack can be created or for existing stacks using the AWS API (UpdateTerminationProtection command). Once enabled, if attempt to delete an AWS CloudFormation stack with the feature enabled, the deletion fails and the stack (including its current status), will remain unchanged. For production stacks, Organization strongly recommends to use termination protection feature in addition to a well-defined stack policy in order to make stack even safer.",
