## Cloud Security Requirements ##

### 1. Ensure IAM roles to access Amazon S3 Glacier are following least privilege model

**Security Control Mapping :**  <br>
| Control Number | Control Statement | Security Domain | Default | Associated Runbook | CVSS Severity  |
| -------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| CS0012298 | Access to change cloud identity access and service control policies is restricted to authorized cloud administrative personnel |  Identity & Access Management | Not enabled |None | [Medium (6.5)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L) |

**Why?** <br>
    By default, IAM users and roles don't have permission to create or modify Amazon S3 Glacier resources. They also can't perform tasks using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS API. An IAM administrator must create IAM policies that grant users and roles permission to perform actions on the resources that they need. The administrator must then attach those policies to the IAM users or groups that require those permissions.

**How?** <br>

### 2. Ensure data within S3 Glacier is encrypted at rest using organization managed key(CMK)

**Security Control Mapping :** <br>
| Control Number | Control Statement | Security Domain | Default | Associated Runbook | CVSS Severity  |
| -------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| CS0012168 |Strong encryption key management controls are in place for cloud provider services to protect data at rest | Data Protection | Enabled | None | [Medium (5.3)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L) |

**Why?** <br>

### 3. Ensure data are encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2

**Security Control Mapping :**  <br>
| Control Number | Control Statement | Security Domain | Default | Associated Runbook | CVSS Severity  |
| -------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| CS0012261 | Cloud based data in transit must be encrypted with enterprise approved algorithms. | Data Protection | Not enabled | None | [Medium (5.3)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L) |

### 4. Ensure to enable Cloudtrail for Amazon S3 Glacier

**Security control mapping:** <br>
| Control Number | Control Statement | Security Domain | Default | Associated Runbook |CVSS Severity|
| ------------------ | ------------| --------------- | ------- | ------------------ |---|
| CS0012233| Information system must create a log and record activities occurring on or originating from the information system.Logs must be made accessible to the enterprise SIEM solution  | Security Information and event management | Not Enabled | None|[Low(2.5)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L)|

**Why?** <br>
    
Amazon S3 Glacier is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in Amazon S3 Glacier. CloudTrail captures a subset of API calls for Amazon S3 Glacier as events, including calls from the Amazon S3 Glacier console and from code calls to the Amazon S3 Glacier API operations.

**How?** <br>

<br><br> 

### 5.  Ensure to monitor Amazon S3 Glacier using Cloudwatch

**Security control mapping:** <br>
| Control Number | Control Statement | Security Domain | Default | Associated Runbook |CVSS Severity|
| ------------------ | ------------| --------------- | ------- | ------------------ |---|
| CS0012233| Information system must create a log and record activities occurring on or originating from the information system.Logs must be made accessible to the enterprise SIEM solution  | Security Information and event management | Not Enabled | None|[Low(3.9)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)|

**Why?** <br>
    
Amazon S3 Glacier is integrated with AWS Cloudwatch, a service which is a metrics repository for AWS services that allow security teams to retrieve statistics based on the metrics and dimensions published by Amazon S3 Glacier. Organization's security team recommends to use these metrics to configure alarms, calculate statistics and then present the data in a dashboard which helps to assess the health of Amazon S3 Glacier environment.

**How?** <br>

<br><br> 

### 6. Ensure Amazon S3 Glacier uses standard organizational resource tagging method

**Security control mapping:** <br>
| Control Number | Control Statement | Security Domain | Default | Associated Runbook |CVSS Severity|
| ------------------ | ------------| --------------- | ------- | ------------------ |---|
|CS0012128| Technology hardware and software must be registered and accurately recorded within the enterprise technology repository and/or asset management systems | Asset Management | Not Enabled | Organizational Runbook |[Low(1.6)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)|


**What, Why & How?** <br>

Identification of your IT assets is a crucial aspect of governance and security. You need to have visibility of all Cloudformation resources to assess their security posture and take action on potential areas of weakness.

Tagging resources in the cloud is an easy way for teams to provide information related to who owns the resource, what the resource is used for, as well as other important information related to the deployment lifecycle of the resource. Organization has mandated that all cloud resources are to be tagged with for cross-team use.

### Glossary 

**Data** - Digital pieces of information stored or transmitted for use with an information system from which understandable information is
derived. Items considered to be data are: Source code, meta-data, build artifacts, information input and output.

**Information System** - An organized assembly of resources and procedures for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing,
dissemination, or disposition of information. All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual
client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices,
applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party
platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Log** - a record of the events occurring within information systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains
information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.

**Information** - communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual,
numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual.

**Cloud Computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing
resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal
management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**- Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited
or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy
risks.
